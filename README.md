# Selinux Policy Merger

This utility is helpful when there is a need to merge two SeLinux policies.
It requires two input files and a destination file. If the destination file already exists, it will be deleted

```
SelinuxPolicyMerger.py --file1 file1_to_merge --file2 file2_to_merge --dest file_merged
```
